Group Project 2
Data Analytics

The project visualizes the occurances of murder and robbery in the county of Denver on an annual basis from 2014-2018 in relation to the growth in Denver's population over the same period.

The underlying crime data was obtained from the "Denver Crime Data" file on Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/denver-crime-data, which is populated by official crime data from the City of Denver.

The annual Denver population data was obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.
